          The name Nairobi originates from a Maasai term, Enkare Nyorobi, which
          translates to "cool waters" and refers to a water hole. Originally,
          Nairobi was a swampy area, which in 1899 was established as a railway
          camp for the Uganda Railway. In 1905, the place was designated as the
          capital of Kenya, surpassing Mombasa and Machakos, which were the
          previous capitals of the nation. Nonetheless, in early 1900s, the town
          suffered from outbreaks of diseases that led to its destruction and
          subsequent reconstruction. The presence of a railway played a
          significant role in its rapid growth, impelling Nairobi to become the
          second largest city in Kenya after Mombasa. Besides, the city
          flourished based on its role in administration and the development of
          tourism, predominantly when it comes to big game hunting.

              Hi! My name is Brenda Omondi. I have been living in Nairobi for
              more than 10 years. I love the city because of its vibrant
              cultural scene, diverse population, and the exciting blend of
              modern and traditional elements that create a unique and dynamic
              atmosphere. I created this page as part of a project for SheCodes
              Responsive. I enjoyed this exercise since it enhanced my coding
              skills.
