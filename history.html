          The name Nairobi originates from a Maasai term, Enkare Nyorobi, which
          translates to "cool waters" and refers to a water hole. Originally,
          Nairobi was a swampy area, which in 1899 was established as a railway
          camp for the Uganda Railway. In 1905, the place was designated as the
          capital of Kenya, surpassing Mombasa and Machakos, which were the
          previous capitals of the nation. Nonetheless, in early 1900s, the town
          suffered from outbreaks of diseases that led to its destruction and
          subsequent reconstruction. The presence of a railway played a
          significant role in its rapid growth, impelling Nairobi to become the
          second largest city in Kenya after Mombasa. Besides, the city
          flourished based on its role in administration and the development of
          tourism, predominantly when it comes to big game hunting.
