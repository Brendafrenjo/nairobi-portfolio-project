              Hi! My name is Brenda Omondi. I have been living in Nairobi for
              more than 10 years. I love the city because of its vibrant
              cultural scene, diverse population, and the exciting blend of
              modern and traditional elements that create a unique and dynamic
              atmosphere. I created this page as part of a project for SheCodes
              Responsive. I enjoyed this exercise since it enhanced my coding
              skills.
